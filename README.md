## you need another group chat like you need a hole in the head

I used to use a group chat application that shall remain nameless.  I was looking at their privacy policy
and noticed that it didn't say: "We promise not to keep the contents of your messages forever and sell 
them to the mafia."  I sent an email to the address listed on their privacy page.  

I never got a response.

I take this to mean: "We'll keep all your data forever on really insecure servers because from our perspective,
your security is a cost center."

So I dropped them and wrote up my own using Tropo.com's api.  Problem solved.
